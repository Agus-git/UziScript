UziScript
=========

UziScript is a concurrent programming language and virtual machine for educational robotics. The current implementation only supports Arduino as hardware platform but we plan to support other boards in the future.

## Documentation

For instructions on how to download, install, and use the software (as well as more detailed documentation) see [here](/docs/README.md).

## Videos

If you want to see Physical Bits in action you can watch this [demo](https://youtu.be/VMX5ltAYxYY). It's recorded in spanish but it has english subtitles.

You can also watch some old videos in the following [playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL1aXD47455XPWv4rTXQBuHvamCoNUGeke). These videos are based on an older prototype that is no longer available but I keep them anyway because they show some nice features of the language and virtual machine.
