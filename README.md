Physical Bits
=========

Physical Bits (formerly known as UziScript) is a programming environment for educational robotics that supports live and autonomous programming using both a blocks-based and text-based programming language.

The current implementation supports Arduino as hardware platform. We have tested the firmware using several different boards, including: Arduino UNO, Micro, Nano, MEGA 2560, and Yun. We have also received reports of it working successfully on other compatible boards such as DuinoBot, Educabot, and TotemDUINO.

We plan to support other platforms such as ESP8266 and ESP32 in the future.

## Documentation

For instructions on how to download, install, and use the software (as well as more detailed documentation) see [here](/docs/README.md).

## Videos

If you want to see Physical Bits in action you can watch this [demo](https://youtu.be/VMX5ltAYxYY). It's recorded in spanish but it has english subtitles.

You can also watch some old videos in the following [playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL1aXD47455XPWv4rTXQBuHvamCoNUGeke). These videos are based on an older prototype that is no longer available but I keep them anyway because they show some nice features of the language and virtual machine.
