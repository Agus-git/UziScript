UziScript
=========

UziScript is a concurrent programming language and virtual machine for educational robotics. The current implementation only supports Arduino as hardware platform but we plan to support other boards in the future.

For instructions on how to download, install, and use the software (as well as more detailed documentation) see [here](/docs/README.md).
