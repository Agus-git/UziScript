# UziScript Documentation

## Description of the language

UziScript syntax is based on C, which is familiar to most programmers including Arduino developers. The `task` keyword has been added to represent behavior that can be executed periodically at a configurable rate. For example, the following code will declare a task that will toggle the LED on pin 13 every second.

```
task blink() running 1/s { toggle(D13); }
```

UziScript does not require any type declarations, so to distinguish a function from a procedure two new keywords are introduced: `func` and `proc`.

```
func isOn(pin) { return read(pin) > 0.5; }
 
proc toggle(pin) {
  if isOn(pin) { turnOff(pin); }
  else { turnOn(pin); }
}
```

A program can have any number of tasks, and each task can be defined with a different interval as well as a different starting state, which can be either `running` or `stopped`. Additionally, special tasks that need to be run just once can be defined using the keyword `once` after the task name. This is especially useful to initialize variables and can be used as a substitute to the Arduino `setup()` function. 

The execution of each task at the correct time is performed automatically by the virtual machine but the user can invoke certain primitives to start, stop, pause, or resume a given task. Each task execution is independent, it has its own stack, and it shares memory with other tasks through specially defined global variables. This design allows users to write sequential programs in Arduinoâ€™s usual style and make them run concurrently without being concerned about the processor scheduling. 

Primitive instructions like `delay()` are provided to allow the user to block the executing task for a given amount of time without affecting the rest. Arduino related primitives are also included but in some cases their names and behavior were modified to offer a simplified interface with the hardware. For example, the Arduino `digitalRead()` and `analogRead()` functions are merged into a single UziScript function called `read()`, which accepts a pin number and returns a floating-point value. If the pin is digital the resulting value can either be 0 or 1 but if the pin is analog the function will normalize its value between 0 and 1. An equivalent implementation of the `write()` procedure is also provided. We believe these small design details make the language more accessible to beginners by providing a concise (and consistent) interface to the hardware.

UziScript also supports external libraries that can extend the primitive functionality of the language. You can find examples [here](/uzi/libraries).

## Implementation

The UziScript firmware is a regular Arduino sketch written in C++ that can be uploaded using the Arduino IDE. The entire source code is open for inspection and modification. We believe this to be very important for the adoption of the platform. First, being open source allows for more advanced students or teachers to learn from its implementation and improve it to suit their own needs. Second, installing the firmware is as simple as uploading any Arduino sketch so the time it takes to test the platform is reduced.

We initially target the Arduino UNO because it is the most popular model amongst beginners but we plan to support other models in the future.

Internally, the firmware implements a stack-based high-level language virtual machine that uses a decode and dispatch bytecode interpreter to execute UziScript programs. This implementation was chosen mainly because of its simplicity. Since the purpose of this language is educational, performance is not currently considered a high priority.

For now, the stack and global variables are the only available memory to the user program. There is no heap or dynamic memory allocation implemented yet. This allows for simpler virtual machine code and compact object code. Almost all the instructions can be encoded using one byte for both the opcode and its arguments and just a few special instructions (such as branches) require an extra byte.

Apart from the virtual machine, the firmware includes a monitor program that allows to interact with a computer through the serial port. Periodically, this monitor program will send the status of the Arduino and receive commands, allowing the host computer to fully control the virtual machine.

By having these two programs running on the Arduino we can provide an interactive programming experience with a short feedback loop without sacrificing autonomy. Moreover, the monitor program permits the implementation of debugging tools that allow the user to stop the execution of any task, inspect the value of all the variables, explore the call stack, and execute instructions step by step. These kind of debugging capabilities, which we consider to be essential in an educational context, are only available on the Arduino platform using either extra hardware or the more advanced Arduino Zero.

On the computer side we implemented a small set of tools that allow to edit, compile, debug, and transmit the programs to the Arduino board through the serial port. All these tools were developed using [Squeak](https://squeak.org/), an open source version of [Smalltalk](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smalltalk). We are also working on a web-based version of the tools that will allow to write UziScript programs using a visual interface supported by [Blockly](https://developers.google.com/blockly/).

The compilation process transforms UziScript programs into bytecode suitable for the virtual machine to execute. Below is an example of the generated bytecode from a simple UziScript program. As you can see, the notation used to represent the bytecodes is also valid Smalltalk code that, when evaluated, will produce an instance of the program.
